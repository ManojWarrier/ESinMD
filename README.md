Discussion on adding electronic stopping in MD

We have added electronic stopping losses in the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS (http:\\lammps.sandia.gov). See https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11940 for the documentation and validation of the code.

This is intended to be a discussion of the equations and references.
